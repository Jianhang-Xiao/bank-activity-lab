* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling


### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter


## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)
I started to do a for loop that iterates over each rwo in a data structure refreerd to as "self.data." I also created a new list called "new_row" which uses a list comprehension to interate through each element in the "row" list. The list also started from the second elment by skipping the first element and converted each element to a float. I also filtered out non-numeric values. The loop continues to the next row and reperated for each row until finish. 
I implemented avearge funcaiton, median funcation, and standard deviation funcation for each task.
